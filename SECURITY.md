# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any identified security vulnerabilities using the security reporting form available [here](https://github.com/co-devs/researchkit-extension/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained during personal time; however, I will review and respond to all submissions as promptly as possible. Confirmed vulnerabilities will be addressed with appropriate urgency based on their severity. I also welcome collaboration from reporters who are willing and able to assist in the remediation process.

To protect users, I ask that confirmed vulnerabilities remain confidential until a patch has been published to the Chrome Web Store and a sufficient portion of the user base has received the update.

With permission, Iâ€™m happy to include acknowledgements in the repository for those who report confirmed vulnerabilities.
